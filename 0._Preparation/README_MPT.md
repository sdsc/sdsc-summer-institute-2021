# Preparing for the Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

 ## Computer and Laptop Set-up: <a name="computer-req"></a>
* We recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* After you access your account information, confirm that you can login (SSH) to Expanse using the device you plan to use during the CIML Summer Institute (laptop, workstation, etc...).  Detailed instructions on connecting to Expanse using SSH can be found [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems).  

It has been suggested that a second monitor may be helpful during online instruction.  While one monitor could be used to follow instruction, the other for the hands-on.  Additionally, the use of a mouse may be beneficial as well during some sessions.

* When setting up your “display name” on Zoom & Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))

### Zoom:  <a name="zoom"></a>
 You will need to install the latest [Zoom](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/zoom.us/download__;!!Mih3wA!UGXaOZYQHBMwc07Vt0SbIo6BuDVjS0wz54dT6sb7Q9QMDnX831-1_4ewcxi5fw$) client, which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, Once installed, you can test your microphone and camera interface with Zoom here. You can find more information on Zoom system requirements, including bandwidth requirements here.  

To ensure the security of our Zoom links, details will be sent to all participants just prior to preparation day (June 18) and again prior to CIML Summer Institute week (June 22-24).  Zoom details for all sessions will be unique.

### Slack:  <a name="slack"></a>
* We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download ([Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac), or [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)) and [get started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users). Zoom chat will be disabled. Make sure to turn on your notifications to receive alerts.  
* When setting up your “display name” on Zoom & Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))

### Github: <a name="github"></a>
* Most of the training material will be located on the CIML Summer Institute GitHub repo and one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. * If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   
* For examples of using GitHub on Expanse, see: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/using_github


  ##### Using GitHub<a name="github"></a>

* Most of the training material will be located on the [CIML SI21 GitHub repo](https://github.com/ciml-org/ciml-summer-institute-2021). In addition, one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).
